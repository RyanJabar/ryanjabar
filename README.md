# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

- 🎓I am Ryan Jabar, a High School student who enjoys coding advanced projects as well as taking Computer Science classes.  I am a Freelancer, a Full-Stack Dev, and a Software Dev
- 👨‍💻I enjoy to partake in large projects with others as I feel that it builds my experiences within computer science and software engineering. I 
am currently certified in Python which I would say is my best-known language, and I am also learning other languages such as JS (React.js), HTML, and CSS to improve my 
website design skills.
